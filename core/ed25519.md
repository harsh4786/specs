# ED25519 Signatures
Ed25519 is a type of EdDSA using SHA-512 and Curve25519 elliptic curve.

## Usage
Solana uses ed25519-dalek library with the edwards representation of Curve25519  the signature verification is done using “verify_restrict” function. 
Ed25519 digital signature scheme was standardized in RFC8032. Although the standardization, there are variations in signature verification in different implementations. Some variations have their own custom criteria that are check the validity of the signatures. We have to ensure that the signatures are non-malleable, can be verified in constant time and have abstracted implementation.

## Structure
Each ed25519 signature is serialized into a fixed 64 byte sized array represented as [u8; 64] in rust. The Publickey is a [u8; 32] in serialized form. The verifier equation is of unbatched type given by R = [s]G - [k]P.

## Algorithm
The user generates a Keypair which is a combination of a Private key and a Public key.
The private key 's' is generated from a Cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator and is a scalar.

The scalar is multiplied by the Curves basepoint / generator 'G' to give the publickey.

P = s.G

To generate a signature of a message M, the user first has to  generate a random number 'r' and multiply it with the basepoint G resulting in R.
R = r.G

Then a hash 'k'  is generated using SHA-512 algorithm:
k = H(R, P, M)

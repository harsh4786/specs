# ED25519 Signatures

## Usage
Solana uses ed25519-dalek library with the edwards representation of Curve25519  the signature verification is done using “verify_restrict” function 
Each ed25519 signature is serialized into a fixed 64 byte sized array represented as [u8; 64] in rust. The Publickey is a [u8; 32] in serialized form.

# ED25519 Signatures

## Usage
Solana uses ed25519-dalek library with the edwards representation of Curve25519  the signature verification is done using “verify_restrict” function. 
Ed25519 digital signature scheme was standardized in RFC8032. Although the standardization, there are variations in signature verification in different implementations. Some variations have their own custom criteria that are check the validity of the signatures. We have to ensure that the signatures are non-malleable, can be verified in constant time and have abstracted implementation.

## Structure
Each ed25519 signature is serialized into a fixed 64 byte sized array represented as [u8; 64] in rust. The Publickey is a [u8; 32] in serialized form. The verifier equation is of unbatched type given by $ R = [s]B - [k]A.
